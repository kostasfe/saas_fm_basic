# SaaS Financial Model (Basic)

This repository contains a spreadsheet that SaaS companies can use to forecast and analyse financial and operational results with relatively little effort. An example spreadsheet filled with fictional company data is also provided under the `examples` folder.

The blog post [SaaS FM - A Financial Model for SaaS Companies](https://www.prodigi.to/blog/tools/a-basic-financial-model-for-saas.html) describes the model and its benefits in more detail.
